# Copypasta
**Description:** You know those funny Internet messages that everybody likes to copy and paste? Yeah....

Turns out they make a good Warmups CTF challenge, too!

## Solution

1. I started the instance and connected to the server via my terminal and it returned the following copypasta

1. I was confused and fell into a rabbit hole but upon highlighting the entire text with my cursor, the flag revealed itself.

    It appeared that the text for the flag had a color overlay that made the text invisible as it matched the background unitl it was highlighted

My elite black, hacker terminal didn't let me read the text at first...
